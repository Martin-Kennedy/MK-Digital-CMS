## MK DIGITAL CMS FRONTEND

A Robust React / Redux Application. The majority of business logic is located in the surf app actions and reducer files. This project takes data from many api endpoints as well as from my own CMS backend and acts as the hub for all things I have worked on and are working on. Check out some of the projects I've been working on or check out some swell / surf forecasting that I am in the process of building https://mkdigital.io/swell. More surf spots are added frequently and functionality updates are being made monthly so check back often!
